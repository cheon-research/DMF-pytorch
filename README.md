# DMF pytorch implementation

Non-official Implementation for "Deep Matrix Factorization Models for Recommender Systems"  
In Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 3119â€“3125 (IJCAI 2017)  

https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2017/0447.pdf  

It is not sure that this implementation has same performance with authors' experiments.  
(Followed the authors' experimental setups as much as possible.)  

## Implemented on following environments
	* python==3.7.6
	* pytorch==1.4.0
	* numpy==1.18.1
	* pandas==1.0.0
	* scipy==1.4.1

## Notes
If you have any idea to make faster in sparse matrix indexing(input interaction history), please let me know.
